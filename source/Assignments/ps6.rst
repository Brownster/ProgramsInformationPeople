Week 6: ends October 12
=======================

1. Do the multiple choice questions and exercises in the textbook chapters, including the ones at the bottom of the chapters, below the glossary. Don't forget to click Save for each of the exercises, and always access the textbook by clicking on the link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in.
   
   * Before Tuesday's class: 
      * Read :ref:`Optional and Keyword Parameters<optional_params_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
      * Read `Blog post and demo of sliding window compression  <http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/>`_
   
   * Before Thursday's class:
       * Read :ref:`Tuples<tuples_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
       * Read :ref:`Nested Data Structures and Nested Iteration<nested_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
       * Read :ref:`Installing a Native Python Interpreter and Text Editor <install_python_chap>` and follow the instructions to set up for running python on your computer

 
#. Reading responses

   * By Monday midnight: 
      * Read `Tutorial on unix diff <http://www.computerhope.com/unix/udiff.htm>`_ (This will help you understand the section of "The Most Human Human" below).
      * Read *The Most Human Human*, Chapter 10, p.237-259.
      * Answer :ref:`Reading Response 7 <reading_response_7>`. 

#. Problem set **Due:** **Sunday, October 12 at 5 pm**

   * Do the :ref:`Native Python Interpreter and Text Editor part of Problem Set 6. <unix_pset6>`
   
   * Save answers to the exercises in Problem Set 6: :ref:`Problem Set 6 <problem_set_6>` 



Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_7:

Suppose you write and edit a long text file over the course of several days, saving a new version every 15 minutes or so (``myfile1.txt``, ``myfile2.txt``, ``myfile3.txt``,...). Eventually, you have 100 different versions of the file. Now consider the whole directory containing all 100 versions of the file. Would it have a lot of redundancy? As a compression technique, how might you take advantage of the unix diff command in order to reduce the total amount of space required to store all 100 versions of the file?

.. activecode:: rr_7_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """
   print s



If you were to compute information entropy scores for all the students you've met since enrolling at the University of Michigan, which of them has the highest entropy and why? 

.. activecode:: rr_7_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """
   print s


Command Line Problems
---------------------

.. _unix_pset6:

Turn these in as screenshots via CTools in the Assignments tab!

#. Something that requires editing a file in the text editor and saving it as a new file name.

#. Something that requires running a diff command to show what's different between the two.

#. Something that requires running the native python interpreter on the program.
