Programs, Information, People
=============================

This project began with the original How to Think Like a Computer Scientist text by Jeffrey Elkner, Peter Wentworth, Allen B. Downey, Chris  Meyers, and Dario Mitchell.  Since 2011 Brad Miller, David Ranum, Barbara Ericson, Mark Guzdial, and many others have built on the text making it interactive.  Paul Resnick further modified the source to make this book.


Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.  

1. You can see and read this book online at `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pip2/index.html>`_

2.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/pip2``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/pip2``
