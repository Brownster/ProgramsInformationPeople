Activities through 11/29
========================

You have the following graded activities:

* Before Monday's class:
   * Read :ref:`List comprehensions<list_comp_chap>` and do the exercises in the chapter

* Before Wednesdays's class:
   * Read :ref:`Recursion <recursion_chap>`
      * In class, we'll do a few of the exercises.
   * NOTE: Recursion is really cool, but it won't be on the final exam or problem sets. So come to class on Wednesday and get exposed to an idea that will change how you think about the world, but without too much stress because you don't have to master it this semester. I'll also show you some more tricks for extracting data from nested structures that might help you with PS11.

* By Sunday 11/29 at 5PM:
   * Complete Problem Set 11, via Canvas.

* By Sunday midnight:
    * Read the tutorial on GitHub. You will not need to create or use a github repository for this course, but this will help prepare you for the reading and reading response for Wednesday and some later chapters in the Weber book.
        * `Part I <http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1>`_
        * `Part II <http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2>`_
    * (now delayed until Tuesday night) Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 4
    * (now delayed until Tuesday night) Read about the `Drupal open source community <https://medium.com/@heyrocker/this-article-was-originally-a-keynote-presentation-at-the-pacific-northwest-drupal-summit-in-5e7c7f93131b>`_. Drupal is a "Content Management System" that makes it relatively easy to develop websites that have dynamic content and interactive features like commenting and tagging. Note: it may be helpful in reading the article to know that "Dries" is `Dries Buytaert <http://buytaert.net/>`_, the person who started Drupal and "webchick" is the username chosen by `Angie Byron <http://www.webchick.net/about>`_, a prominent member of the community.
    * (now delayed until Tuesday night) :ref:`Reading response 11 <reading_response_11>`
