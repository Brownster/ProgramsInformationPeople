Activities through 11/29
========================

You have the following graded activities:

* Before Monday's class:
   * Read :ref:`List comprehensions<list_comp_chap>` and do the exercises in the chapter

* Before Wednesdays's class:
   * Read :ref:`Recursion <recursion_chap>`
      * In class, we'll do a few of the exercises.
   * NOTE: Recursion is really cool, but it won't be on the final exam or problem sets. So come to class on Wednesday and get exposed to an idea that will change how you think about the world, but without too much stress because you don't have to master it this semester. I'll also show you some more tricks for extracting data from nested structures that might help you with PS11.

* By Sunday 11/15 at 5PM:
   * Complete Problem Set 11, via Canvas.

* By Sunday midnight:
    * Read the tutorial on GitHub. You will not need to create or use a github repository for this course, but this will help prepare you for the reading and reading response for Wednesday and some later chapters in the Weber book.
        * `Part I <http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1>`_
        * `Part II <http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2>`_
    * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 4
    * Read about the `Drupal open source community <https://medium.com/@heyrocker/this-article-was-originally-a-keynote-presentation-at-the-pacific-northwest-drupal-summit-in-5e7c7f93131b>`_. Drupal is a "Content Management System" that makes it relatively easy to develop websites that have dynamic content and interactive features like commenting and tagging. Note: it may be helpful in reading the article to know that "Dries" is `Dries Buytaert <http://buytaert.net/>`_, the person who started Drupal and "webchick" is the username chosen by `Angie Byron <http://www.webchick.net/about>`_, a prominent member of the community.

Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_11:

Answer the following questions.
    1. The linux project uses git to organize the work of all the contributors. Take a look at the `linux project on github <https://github.com/torvalds/linux>`_. Take a look at the recent commits. Click around to see how many people have made contributions recently. Also check out the github page for `Runestone <https://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone>`_ and for `this textbook, which is built on Runestone <https://github.com/presnick/ProgramsInformationPeople>`_. Report on something interesting you found from exploring these public git repositories.

    2. The chapter describes forking as something that could fragment developer efforts and thus slow down progress of a project. If you tried to make a "fork" of Linux today, would it be technically feasible to do so? What do you think would happen?

    3. Pages 116-119 describes the genesis of "Bitkeeper", which later was replaced by git. Why would the promise of switching to use something like git have helped to defuse a potential forking of the Linux project?

    4. What seems similar and what seems different between the Linux project's developer community and the Drupal project's developer community?
