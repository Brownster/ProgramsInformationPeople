Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_9:

Answer the following questions. 

1. Why is the GPL described as `viral`? Do you think it gives programmers more or less "freedom" to do what they want with software than the BSD-style license does?

#. The chapter describes the idea of pipes as an important breakthrough. It's referring to the < > and | operators that you used in the unix shell previously. Why are those a breakthrough?

#. What material from the chapter would you like to discuss in class?

.. activecode:: rr_9_1
