Activities through 11/4
=======================

You have the following graded activities:

* **Before Monday's class, 10/31:**
    * Read :ref:`Sorting<sort_chap>`, and try the exercises in that chapter
    * Read :ref:`Importing modules<modules_chap>` and :ref:`Unit Testing<unit_test_chap>` TODO

    .. usageassignment

* ** Before Wednesday's class, 11/2:**
    * Read `these slides on Canvas <UPDATE LINK>`_
    * Read :ref:`REST APIs <UPDATE>` and try the exercises
    * Read :ref:`Unicode strings <UPDATE>`

* **Wednesday, 11/2 at 7 pm** is the second chance midterm. You should have signed up on the link provided in the Canvas announcement last week.

* **Before 11/4, Friday, at 6:30 PM:**
    * Starting this week, the main problem set is distributed via Canvas. There is an assignment called `PS 7 <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/48961/assignments/55801>`_. It includes a file called ``ps7.py``. You should download a copy of it. Make sure you know where you save it. We recommend starting a new folder to save the programs you write in this course. (Especially since now know how to do all that at the command prompt.)

    * Instructions for the code to write in that file appear on this page, in :ref:`Problem Set 7 <problem_set_7>`. The same will be true for each of the problem sets for the rest of the semester: there will be a file (or multiple files) for you to download, and instructions on the graded activities page, like this one.

    * The ps7.py file you'll download contains just a few instructions, plus the code for the tests you'll run. Previously, you the code for tests has been hidden. This week, you'll be learning about how to write tests for your code, and you'll see the tests for your PSet problems that we provide for you.

    * You should edit the ``ps7.py`` code file on your laptop or workstation using Sublime Text, and test what you've done by running the program, using your native Python interpreter. 

    * When you are done, submit your ``.py`` file via Canvas to the PS7 assignment (and submit your Demonstrate Understanding assignment, linked in the instructions below, as usual).

    * As always, you have a grace period for your Problem Set and DYU assignment until Sunday 11/6 at 5 PM.
