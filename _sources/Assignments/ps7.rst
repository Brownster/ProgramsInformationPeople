Activities through 3/1
======================

You have the following graded activities:

1. Class prep. Don't forget: always access the textbook by clicking on the Textbook link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in and get credit for doing the prep.
   
   * Before Monday's class:
       * Read :ref:`Sorting<sort_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
 
#. Reading responses

   * None this week

#. Problem set

   * None this week
   


.. note::

   This is a transition week, as we start to move toward writing complete programs in text files and running them from the command prompt, rather than working on several stand-alone problems in a browser. Starting with the next problem set, you won't be able to write and run code in the browser. This week, to help you see how the two ways of running code are related, you will write the code you have done it for previous problem sets, and then also copy your answers into a code file and make the code file run from the command line. Read to the bottom to see the instructions for what to submit via cTools, in addition to saving your code in the usual way in the browser.



11. Now you have to copy all your answers into a single file and run that file from the command prompt.

   * From cTools, look in the Assignments tab, at PS 6.
      * download ps6.py into whatever directory on your local machine that you used last week for saving and running python files
      * download test106.py into that same directory (very important!)

   * Follow the instructions in ps6.py, which repeat the instructions for the problems above. Feel free to copy your code from the browser.

   * Run your program from the command prompt and make sure all the tests pass. Then uncomment the last line and take a screenshot showing that the hangman game is playing correctly.

   * Submit your .py file and the screenshot via cTools.

All done!
